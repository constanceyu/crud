# Exercise 1

In this exercise you will:
- Create a small database with 3 tables
- Populate the database with some data
- Make queries to the database

## The Data

In the file `kubrick_films.csv` you will find a set of data about movies directed by Stanley Kubrick, including date, budget, box office sales, and leading actors.

## Task 1 - Create the database

1. Open the file `schema.sql` which contains some stubs for CREATE statements for the database. Complete the statements such that you end up with the following three tables.

    - `film` table
        - must have an `id` primary key generated by the DB
        - must have a `title` of type VARCHAR(128)
        - must have a `year` of type INTEGER
        - may have a `duration` of type INTEGER
        - may have a `budget` of type INTEGER
        - may have a `boxOffice` of type INTEGER
        - may have a `genre` of type VARCHAR(32)
        - may have a `complexGenre` of type VARCHAR(64)
        - may have a `rating` of type REAL
        - may have a `IMDBvotes` of type REAL
    - `actor` table
        - must have an `id` primary key generated by the DB
        - must have a `name` field of type VARCHAR(64) that is unique
    - `starring` table
        - must have a `filmID` foreign key of type INTEGER
        - must have a `actorID` foreign key of type INTEGER

2. Now create the database by entering the following at the command line:

        sqlite3 kubrick.db

3. Inside the SQLite shell, copy and paste your SQL statements.


## Task 2 - Populate the database

1. Open the file `populate.sql` and add INSERT statements for each film in the CSV file.

2. Inside the SQLite shell, copy and paste your SQL statements.

## Task 3 - Query the database

1. Open the file `query.sql` and complete the 4 queries such that:

    - Query 1: Get the title and year for films made before 1970
    - Query 2: Get the title, year, and boxOffice for all films, sorted by boxOffice, descending
    - Query 3: Get the title of all movies starring Sterling Hayden
    - Query 4: Get the title and rating of all movies with a rating greater than 8.0, in ascending order

2. Inside the SQLite shell, copy and paste your SQL statements.

Your answers should be:
    - x
    - x
    - x
    - x
